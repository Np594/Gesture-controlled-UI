This is my uni 2nd year Applied AI project in which I made a piece of software which tracks hands, recognises gestures and uses these gestures to perform actions on the
computer, i did this using OpenCV, MediaPipe and Pyautogui.

Project Aims:
Create Hand tracking software in python using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
Use this software to recognise gestures.
Use Pyautogui with these gestures to perform actions on the computer.
